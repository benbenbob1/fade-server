# fade-server
Simple node.js server for running on a computer (I used a Raspberry Pi) connected to a fadecandy board. I am using two Neopixel LED strips that have 30 LEDs per strip.

This application relies on the fact that a Fadecandy server is currently running on the host computer.

# Installation
Run the command 'npm install' from inside the fade-server folder

# Running
Run the command 'node app.js' from inside the fade-server folder - this command may have to be run as root (hint: try 'sudo' before the command)
